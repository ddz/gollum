Follow the [Google Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/) for Go code.
However, I prefer that no lines are longer than 80 characters.

Prefer functional programming patterns where applicable.

Make sure that project builds with `go build` and unit tests all pass with `go test`.
Run `gofmt` to ensure that code has proper formatting.
